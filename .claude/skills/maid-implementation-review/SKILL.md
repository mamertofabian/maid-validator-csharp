# MAID Implementation Review

Review MAID-backed implementation work in read-only mode. Confirm the code matches the approved contract and that validation integrity was preserved.

## Rules

- NEVER edit files.
- NEVER modify tests or manifests during review.
- When you are the coordinating reviewer, run an independent read-only reviewer
  subagent before the final verdict whenever the Agent tool is available and
  reviewer agents have not been explicitly disabled for the turn.
- Reviewer subagents must be fresh, context-minimal review agents. Never pass
  prior implementation reasoning, conclusions, or chat transcript unless the
  review explicitly depends on a user quote.
- If your prompt identifies you as the reviewer subagent, do not spawn another
  subagent. Perform the review locally and return the verdict.
- Confirm changed implementation stays within the manifest `files.create` and `files.edit` scope.
- Flag any implementation-phase manifest or behavioral-test edit as a process violation unless explicitly approved by the user.
- Treat concrete behavior regressions, undeclared public API drift, and missing validation as primary findings.
- Audit fidelity to the approved plan, including rationale and `temptations`; passing tests are not sufficient if the implementation took a path the manifest warned against.
- If `plan-revision.md` exists, review it as a stop signal rather than an implementation failure.

## Review Convergence Protocol

- Report every finding you can identify in a single pass. Never drip-feed one
  finding per round. A finding first raised after round 1 must explain why it was not visible in round 1, such as being unmasked by an earlier fix.
- Classify every finding as **blocking** or **advisory**. Blocking findings are
  contract violations, behavioral bugs, scope drift, or validation failures.
  Advisory findings are style preferences, optional hardening, or future-work
  notes. Advisory findings MUST NOT trigger manifest or locked-test revision
  in the current session; record them in the review packet for possible future
  draft manifests.
- After two full review rounds, issue a final verdict that lists residual
  advisories instead of requesting another round, unless a blocking finding
  remains.

## Phase 1 — Identify the Active Manifest

Use the manifest path provided by the user. If none is provided, inspect recent manifests and current changed files to infer the most likely approved contract.

## Phase 2 — Build the Review Packet

Collect the context needed for an independent review:

- active manifest path and whether it was provided or inferred
- changed files from the working tree or compared branch
- relevant diff summary, especially public symbols, tests, and manifest edits
- validation commands already run and their results
- known environment limits that prevented validation
- any `plan-revision.md` stop signal

Do not pass the full implementation transcript to the subagent. Keep the review
independent by passing only the explicit packet above.

## Phase 3 — Run the Reviewer Subagent

Before reporting the final verdict, spawn one read-only reviewer subagent when
the Agent tool is available and reviewer agents have not been explicitly
disabled for the turn:

- use `subagent_type: "maid-implementation-reviewer"`
- pass the review packet explicitly
- instruct the subagent not to edit files and not to spawn further subagents
- wait for the subagent verdict before final handoff

Do not skip the subagent because the current turn did not separately mention
reviewer-agent authorization when repo guidance grants standing authorization.
Fall back to local-only review only when the Agent tool is technically
unavailable or the user explicitly disables reviewer agents for that turn.

Use this prompt shape:

```text
Read-only MAID implementation review requested. Do not edit files. You are the
independent reviewer subagent; do not spawn additional subagents.

Review the current implementation as if running `/review` on the changed files,
with extra attention to the approved MAID manifest:
<manifest path>

Review packet:
- changed files: <files>
- validation results: <commands and outcomes>
- known environment limits: <limits or none>
- plan revision signal: <path or none>

Prioritize findings over summaries. Look for correctness bugs, security or
authorization gaps, privacy leaks, persistence bugs, concurrency/idempotency
failures, runtime incompatibilities, stale manifest references, weak or missing
behavioral tests, and implementation drift from the manifest contract.

Do not treat passing tests or MAID validation as proof of correctness. Inspect
the changed files, relevant call sites, nearby helpers, schema constraints, and
the manifest's declared behavior. Consider how each new public helper or API
will be called from realistic routes, handlers, CLIs, services, or tests.

Return only actionable review output:
- findings first, ordered by severity
- severity labels such as P0/P1/P2
- file and line references
- brief impact explanation
- missing tests when they allow a bug to pass

If there are no findings, say that clearly and mention any residual test gaps or
risk. End with one verdict: ready, needs changes, or needs discussion.
```

## Phase 4 — Review Scope

Compare the working tree or branch state against the manifest:

- only allowed implementation files were changed
- read-only dependency files were not edited without approval
- no undeclared public symbols leaked into strict files

## Phase 5 — Review Declared Artifacts

Confirm declared artifacts exist with the expected names and parent relationships. Treat implementation-validation misses as blockers.

## Phase 6 — Review Plan Fidelity

Compare implementation choices against the approved manifest:

- declared rationale was followed or explicitly justified
- `temptations` risks were not taken
- each relevant `instead` procedure was followed
- no private-state access, private-helper imports, schema loosening, or test-coupled shortcuts were introduced
- no undeclared public API was added to make tests pass

Treat a direct violation of a manifest temptation as a finding even when validation passes.

## Phase 7 — Review Behavioral Coverage

Check that the behavioral tests still exercise the approved contract and that implementation changes did not weaken validation.

## Outcome-Aware MAID Guidance

Outcome records are deterministic manifest data, not agent-only memory. Use
`maid learn`, `maid recall`, and `maid insights` as deterministic context, but
keep implementation review focused on the current manifest, tests, validation,
and changed files.

For implementation review:

- Active insights trigger: review recurring Outcome lessons with `maid insights`
  before reviewing the implementation. Treat insights as advisory aggregate
  evidence for recurring lessons, not as generated narrative authority.
- Use active recall guidance to thread the planner's and implementer's recalled
  evidence into review focus, while still grounding findings in the current
  manifest, tests, validation, and diff.
- After the review verdict is ready, check whether the completed manifest needs an `outcome:` record.
- Outcome capture happens after implementation review and before final handoff.
- Confirm new Outcome lessons cite concrete validation, review, or file evidence.
- Do not mark work ready if Outcome claims are not backed by validation and review evidence.
- To intentionally include instructive failed or abandoned Outcome lessons,
  refresh the index with this opt-in command, then recall from that index:

```bash
maid learn --include-status completed --include-status abandoned
```

  This is an intentional opt-in for failure lessons; the completed-only default
  is unchanged.
- Recalled, aggregated, and digested Outcomes are planning evidence only. They
  do not replace behavioral tests, declared scope, validation, approval, done
  gates, or review, and they do not create an approval, promotion, done, or
  review gate.

### Lesson Type Vocabulary Convergence

Before writing new Outcome lessons, and before coining a new lesson_type, list
the existing lesson_type vocabulary: run `maid insights` and read the
`by_lesson_type` keys. When a fresh validated theme map exists, prefer its
themes' `member_lesson_types` as the canonical families for grouping related
lessons.

Reuse an existing lesson_type when one fits the new lesson. Coin a new
lesson_type only when no existing value fits, and prefer singular,
kebab-or-plain lowercase forms consistent with the existing vocabulary.

This check is advisory and must not block or delay Outcome capture. If
insights or the index is unavailable, capture proceeds with the agent's
best-fit lesson_type and the unavailable vocabulary evidence should be noted
as advisory context only.

### Manifest Outcome Record Check

After the review verdict is ready, check related completed Outcome records to
decide whether this completed manifest needs a new or updated Outcome record:
this Manifest-Derived Outcome Recall step is active recall guidance for review
and Outcome capture.

```bash
maid recall --for-manifest <path>
maid recall --for-manifest <path> --plan-packet
```

If the index is stale, the stale index fails by default. The remedy is to run
`maid learn`, or pass `--allow-stale-index` only when a stale advisory read is
acceptable. If `.maid/outcomes.json` is missing, run `maid learn` once; if no
completed Outcome records exist, report that no advisory history is available
and skip recall.

Use related completed Outcome records to avoid duplicate or unsupported
lessons. Outcome claims still need concrete validation and review evidence.
Recalled Outcomes are planning evidence only. They do not replace behavioral
tests, declared artifacts, validation commands, or implementation review.
After Outcome capture, run `uv run maid learn` to refresh the local `.maid/outcomes.json` advisory index for subsequent recall.
`.maid/outcomes.json` is generated and ignored; do not commit it. If `maid learn` fails, report the refresh failure as advisory unless recall or insights are required for the current task.

### Learning Evidence Digestion

The learning evidence digestion step is advisory evidence handling.

Close the loop between completed Outcome records and current agent decisions;
do not dump a raw recall or insights transcript into the review. Identify
applicable lessons, reject stale or irrelevant lessons with a reason, and state
what changed because of the evidence. For implementation review, name the
effect on review focus, Outcome capture, or candidate follow-up work. The
learning evidence digestion step is advisory evidence handling, not a separate
gate.

## Phase 8 — Run Practical Validation

Where practical, run:

```bash
maid verify --summary --require-plan-lock --require-red-evidence --since <baseline>
maid validate manifests/<slug>.manifest.yaml --mode implementation
maid test --manifest manifests/<slug>.manifest.yaml
```

For high-risk changes where runtime evidence matters, the opt-in gate is
`maid verify --artifact-coverage --knockout`; run it as
`maid verify --artifact-coverage --knockout --since <baseline>`. This
Python-only review gate checks that declared artifacts are executed by tests
and that breaking each declared function or method makes validation fail.

The `maid verify --summary --require-plan-lock --require-red-evidence --since <baseline>` command is the
implementation handoff gate for the approved plan lock and captured red-phase
evidence. Treat E700-E706 plan-lock failures as blockers unless the review
packet explicitly states that opt-in enforcement is out of scope for the task.
E700/E704/E705 requirement errors apply to manifests changed in the task window;
E701/E702/E703/E706 integrity errors are blockers regardless of task window
scope.
Prefer `--summary` for agent and human review handoff because it keeps blocking
failures visible while deduplicating warning storms. Rerun with raw text,
`--json`, `--packet`, or SARIF only when exhaustive machine-readable detail is
needed. Treat older handoff examples such as
`maid verify --require-plan-lock --require-red-evidence --since <baseline>` as superseded unless
raw text is intentionally required.

If the environment or project shape makes a command impractical, say so explicitly.

## Phase 9 — Reconcile and Report

If the reviewer subagent reports findings, decide whether each finding is valid
against the manifest and code. Do not edit files during review. Report valid
findings first; put invalid or out-of-scope reviewer notes in a brief residual
risk or dismissed-notes section only if useful.

Prioritize:

1. blockers
2. should-fix items
3. nitpicks

Include the reviewer subagent result when one was run: verdict and whether it
found blockers.

End with one explicit verdict:

- `Ready to merge`
- `Needs changes`
- `Needs discussion`
